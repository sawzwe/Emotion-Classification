# Emotion Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying facial expressions into seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Neutral, and Surprise. It utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize emotions from facial images. The primary goal is to build a robust emotion classification model that can be applied to various applications such as sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Depression Dataset on Facial Expression Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khairunneesa/depression-dataset-on-facial-ecpression-images). It contains a collection of facial expression images labeled with their corresponding emotions. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the emotion classification model.

## Emotion Classes

The project involves classifying images into the following emotion classes:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Neutral
- Surprise

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing and augmenting the dataset to improve model robustness.
- **Model Development**: Designing and training deep learning models for emotion classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using various metrics and techniques.
- **Deployment**: Preparing the trained model for deployment in real-world applications.

## Dependencies

The following libraries and frameworks were used in this project:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
